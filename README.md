# bosh install #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ottenwbe/bosh-install.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ottenwbe/bosh-install)

A tutorial and a set of scripts for deploying bosh on AWS with terraform.

## A Word of Caution ##

Before you follow the steps in this tutorial you should be aware that you will create real resources on AWS that cost money. 
In particular, the tutorial requires that you deploy more resources than included in Amazon's free tier, i.e., two t2.small and one m3.xlarge instance. 
Obviously, I will not provide compensation for any costs.
